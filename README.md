I learned javascript is importnant. var, let, and const. and creating a function. 

## Eloquent JavaScript 
The book tells us that programming languages are artificially constructed languages used to instruct a computer and programming is the act of constructing a program, a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do. The book also tells us JavaScript is a programming language invented in 1995, initially used for web development, but now is also used in other areas sucha s desktop and server programming. All-in-all the book covers the basics of programming, data types, functions, control structures, and object oriented programming. It also emphasizes the importance of understanding concepts and practicing programming to become efficient. 

## How the Web Works 
The web doc tells us about the client and server interaction where they request and recieve resources from each-other. It also tells us more about how important Internet Connection, TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, and component files (code and assests) are for Web Communication. The process behind it is simple and I'll summarize, the browser requests a website, the server responds with the files, and the browser assembles and displays the page from the information given. The Web doc tells us about the order of component file parsing, HTML is parsed first, followed by CSS and then JavaScript, which in turn forms the page. It also tells us the DNS maps domain names to IP addressess and that the data is sent in small packets for efficient transmision of the data.
